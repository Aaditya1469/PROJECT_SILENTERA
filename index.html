        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are dedicated to combating noise pollution and its effects on our environment. Our mission is to develop innovative solutions that promote a quieter and healthier world.</p>
        <p>Through our research and technology, we aim to create a device that produces opposite frequency sounds to mitigate loud noises, similar to noise-canceling headphones.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Goal and Future Ideas</h2>
        <p>Our primary goal is to create a device capable of generating sounds at opposite frequencies to reduce unwanted noise in urban environments.</p>
        <p>This technology has the potential to transform how we address noise pollution, making our cities more livable and enjoyable.</p>
        <p>We believe that by leveraging advanced sound technology, we can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals living in noisy areas.</p>
        
        <h2>The Harm of Noise Pollution</h2>
        <p>Noise pollution is often an overlooked aspect of environmental health, but its impact on human health is significant. Prolonged exposure to high levels of noise can lead to stress, sleep disturbances, and even cardiovascular issues. Despite the severe health implications, noise pollution is frequently ignored as a priority in urban planning and public health initiatives.</p>
        <p>Beyond human health, noise pollution disrupts wildlife, affecting communication, navigation, and reproductive success among species. As urban areas expand, managing noise pollution becomes crucial to maintaining balanced ecosystems and a healthy environment for all living beings.</p>
        
        <h2>Decibel (dB) Sound Chart</h2>
        <p>The following table shows common sources of noise at various decibel levels and their potential impact on human health.</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Sound Level (dB)</th>
                <th>Source</th>

                <td>Heavy City Traffic, Lawnmower</td>
                <td>Hearing damage after 8 hours of exposure; use of hearing protection recommended.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>100 dB</td>
                <td>Chainsaw, Car Horn (at close range)</td>
                <td>Hearing loss after 15 minutes of exposure; risk of permanent damage.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>120 dB</td>
                <td>Rock Concert</td>
                <td>Pain threshold; immediate hearing damage with prolonged exposure.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>140 dB</td>
                <td>Jet Engine (at close range)</td>
                <td>Severe pain; immediate risk of permanent hearing loss.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>This chart illustrates how even common sounds can pose a risk to our hearing and health, especially if we are exposed to them daily or for extended periods. By raising awareness and promoting noise reduction measures, we can work towards a healthier and quieter environment.</p>
