        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are dedicated to combating noise pollution and its effects on our environment. Our mission is to develop innovative solutions that promote a quieter and healthier world.</p>
        <p>Through our research and technology, we aim to create a device that produces opposite frequency sounds to mitigate loud noises, similar to noise-canceling headphones.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Goal and Future Ideas</h2>
        <p>Our primary goal is to create a device capable of generating sounds at opposite frequencies to reduce unwanted noise in urban environments.</p>
        <p>This technology has the potential to transform how we address noise pollution, making our cities more livable and enjoyable.</p>
        <p>We believe that by leveraging advanced sound technology, we can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals living in noisy areas.</p>
