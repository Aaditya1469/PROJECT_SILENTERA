SILENTERA (Green Guardians) is an innovative project dedicated to raising awareness about noise pollution and its impact on human health and the environment.
This website provides tools and information to measure noise levels and envision a quieter, healthier world through advanced noise-mitigation technology.

Project Overview
Our mission at SILENTERA is to combat noise pollution through awareness and technology. As cities grow noisier, silentERa emphasizes the often-overlooked dangers of noise pollution and presents a vision for a future where urban noise is effectively controlled.
Through this platform, users can understand noise pollutionâ€™s impact, measure real-time noise levels, and learn about potential solutions.

Features
Navbar Navigation: Seamlessly navigate between the Home, Measure Noise, and Contact Us pages.
About Us: Details our commitment to addressing noise pollution with innovative, sound-canceling technology similar to noise-canceling headphones.
Goal and Future Vision: Outlines our goal to develop a device that produces opposing frequencies to reduce urban noise.
Decibel Sound Chart: An interactive sound level chart displaying common sound sources, their decibel (dB) levels, and potential health impacts for awareness.
Noise Measurement Page: Allows users to measure noise levels in real time with visual feedback through a 2D graph. The graph dynamically displays noise levels in decibels, reflecting a realistic noise profile.
Contact Form: A cubic-style form where users can submit their thoughts on noise pollution and potential solutions. This section provides users with an opportunity to engage with our mission and contribute ideas.
